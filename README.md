# Example
---
This example is part of a working project. 
I didn't include the server side. The configuration, and the container and components are working just in the same way as coded here.
I am just learning, and I know this example is not perfect, but I just figured a lot of things that are not very clear in the documentation that may be useful for someone else.

## In this example I use

* React
* Redux
* Bootstrap
* React Bootstrap
* React Bootstrap Table* 
* Redux Form
* Axios
* Webpack
* React DND (Drag and Drop)
* Babel
